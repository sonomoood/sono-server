 I could feel at the time.
 There was no way of knowing.
 Fallen leaves in the night.
 Who can say where they're blowing.
 As free as the wind.
 Hopefully learning.
 Why the sea on the tide.
 Has no way of turning.
 More than this.
 You know there's nothing.
 More than this.
 Tell me one thing.
 More than this.
 You know there's nothing.
 It was fun for a while.
 There was no way of knowing.
 Like a dream in the night.
 Who can say where we're going.
 No care in the world.
 Maybe I'm learning.
 Why the sea on the tide.
 Has no way of turning.
 More than this.
 You know there's nothing.
 More than this.
 Tell me one thing.
 More than this.
 You know there's nothing.
 More than this.

 In the light moved together in the colors of the morning.

 Across the marshes, across the fields below.
 I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.
 If only to take me with them there,.
 Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.
 And the reeds blew in the morning.
 Take me along to the places.
