"A lie to say, ""O my mountain has coal veins and beds to dig.. 500 men with axes and they all dig for me."" A lie to ssay, ""O my. river where mant fish do swim, half of the catch is mine when you haul. your nets in."" Never will he believe that his greed is a blinding. ray. No devil or redeemer will cheat him. He'll take his gold to. where he's lying cold.. A lie to say, ""O my mine gave a diamond as big as a fist."". But with every gem in his pocket, the jewels he has missed. A lie to. say, ""O my garden is growing taller by the day."" He only eats the. best and tosses the rest away. Never will he be believe that his. greed is a blinding ray. No devil or redeemer can cheat him. he'll. take his gold to where he's lying cold. Six deep in the grave.. Something is out of reach. something he wanted. something is out of reach. he's being taunted. something is out of reach. that he can' beg or steal nor can he buy. his oldest pain. and fear in life. there'll not be time. his oldest pain. and fear in life. there'll not be time. A lie to say ""O my forest has trees that block the sun and. when I cut them down I don't answer to anyone."" No, no, never will he. believe that his greed is a blinding ray no devil or redeemer can. cheat. him. He'll take his gold where he's lying cold..";Sad
"You were looking away from me, western skies calling you.. Colors spilling, running dazzling you.. I was looking the other way, voices call from the east,. I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet.. It could be I'm searching for a place so small. with room for everything where worlds on worlds revolve.. But how can we wait?. I wouldn't hold you back.. suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me.. I could say I was writing a song about you and me.. Maybe that verse is yet tobe found, but waits inside of me,. a secret room, a tangled web to unweave.. But how can we wait knowing our ways,. how can we hold on,. still you know it's not too late.";Hurt
"Well they left then in the morning, a hundred pairs of wings. In the light moved together in the colors of the morning. I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone.. Across the marshes, across the fields below.. I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below.. If only to take me with them there,. Tell me the part that shinesIn your heart on the wind.. And the reeds blew in the morning.. Take me along to the places. You've gone when my eyes looked away.. Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning.. Tell me the part that shines in your heart. And the rays of love forever,. Please take me there..";Happy
"She walks alone on the brick lane,. the breeze is blowing.. A year had changed her forever,. just like her grey home.. He used to live so close here,. we'd look for places I can't remember.. The world was safe when she knew him,. she tried to hold him, hold on forever.. For all that never happens and all that never will be,. a candle burning for the love we seldom keep.. The earth was raw in her fingers,. she overturned it.. Considered planting some flowers,. they wouldn't last long,. no one to tend them.. It's funny how these things go,. you were the answer to all the questions.. The memories made her weary,. she shuddered slowly,. she didn't want to.. As a distant summer he began to whisper,. and threw a smile her way.. She looked into the glass,. liquid surface showing that they were melding,. together present past.. So where can I go from here?. The color fading,. he didn't answer.. She felt him slip from her vision.. She tried to hold him, hold on forever.. So close forever,. in a silent frozen sleep..";Sad

"Took me years to make my motives clear. And the days have not been kind. Once a steady gaze and charming smile. Has been buried in the lines I find. I walk in the noise, quiet employs. And darkness seems to know just where I am. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. There are words that never found my lips. There are words I'd soon forget. Thought the trick was never to look back. But it seems I've lost my grip, I slip. The faster we run now, the closer the gun now. And somehow all the bullets bear my name. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. Took the road but should have chased the stars. Now I've lost my own way home. Had a photo of the time we shared. But I burned it long ago, I know. I struck all the matches stuck in the ashes. Forgive me, won't you simply speak my name. Mother wash the devil from my hands. Pray the lord I have the strength to stand. Mother, tell me was it all a lie?. Show me where the angels die. The faster we run now, the closer the gun now. And somehow we all found. The warmth of the gun now (x6). Took the road but should have chased the stars. Now I've lost my own way home. Had a photo of the time we shared. But I burned it long ago (x2)";Confident
For whom do the bells toll. When sentenced to die. The stuttering rifles. Will stifle the cry. The monstrous anger. The fear's rapid rattle. A desert inferno. Kids dying like cattle. Don't tell me. We're not prepared. I've seen today's marine. He's eighteen and he's eager. He can be quite mean. No mock'ries for them. No prayers or bells. The demented choirs. The wailing of shells. The boys holding candles. On untraveled roads. The fear spreads like fire. As shrapnel explodes. I think it's wrong. To conscript our youth. Against their will. When plenty of our citizenry. Really like to kill. What sign posts will lead. To armageddon's fires. What bugles will call them. From crowded grey shires. The women sit quiet. With death on their minds. A slow dusk descending. The drawing of blinds. Make the hunters all line up. It's their idea of fun. And let those be forgiven. Who never owned a gun. Was it him or me. Or the wailing of the dead. The laughing soldiers. Cast their lots. And you can cut the dread.;Sad

"Take me now, baby, here as I am. Hold me close, and try and understand. Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe. Love is a banquet on which we feed. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers. Cause the night belongs to us. Have I a doubt, baby, when I'm alone. Love is a ring a telephone. Love is an angel, disguised as lust. Here in our bed 'til the morning comes. Come on now, try and understand. The way I feel under your command. Take my hand, as the sun descends. They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now. Because the night belongs to lovers. Because the night belongs to us. Because the night belongs to lovers.

"[ Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant ]. . Crowds gather round kneeling at the feet of common thieves. Hungry for the word, but God would never speak through such as these,. such as these. who offer healing hands and balms, and redemption, a few would cross. their palms. They'll tell your troubles to the Lord for how ever much you can afford. Hands holding hands in the circle of the sinners and the saints. Memories that linger from the cradle, placing puzzles in the grave,. in the grave. No mortal skin and bone can live on bread and circuses alone. The spirit needs, must drive the mystery of why you're alive. CHORUS:. They look and their Book and they read. But their cold hearts say, ""Follow me"". Dance in the dust in the frenzy of the desperately in need. Led by the voices of the men who invoke ritual to hide their greed,. hide their greed. Come every tongue, every eye across the crumbling earth and cracking skies. The gates of hell stand open wide, but the path of glory you walk single. file. (Chorus). These men make a cage for the very souls that came here to be free. They turn off their lights for their tents they're fixing to leave. (Instrumental). Follow me. (Chorus 2x).

Come, come nuclear bomb!. Everyday is like sunday. Everyday is silent and grey. Trudging back over pebbles and sand. And a strange dust lands on your hands. (and on your face).

why are some men born. with minds that earn degrees. the loving cups. gilded plaques. grace their study walls. hide the cracks. while their genius is turned. to works of tyranny then. off to market to market. go selling these. with words so fiery and persuasive. they steal cunningly. riches no one can exceed. and why are some men born. with a fate of poverty. one firm bed. for a swollen back. year by year. the bodies wracked while. their obedience is had. with gradual defeat. by the pace by the pace. and the urgency. through a muddled thought. they phrase it.

"[ Spoken intro from: Women's Diaries of the Westward Journey (by Lillian Schlissel) ]. ""While the young folks were having their good times. some of the mothers were giving birth to their babies.. Three babies were born in our company that summer.. My cousin, Emily, gave birth to a son in Utah,. forty miles north of the Great Salt Lake one morning.. But the next morning she traveled on. 'til noon when a stop was made and another child was born,. this time Susan Mollmeyer.. And gave the baby the name Alice Nevada."". Follow the typical signs, the hand-painted lines, down prairie roads.. Pass the lone church spire.. Pass the talking wire from where to who knows?. There's no way to divide the beauty of the sky from the wild western plains.. Where a man could drift, in legendary myth, by roaming over spaces.. The land was free and the price was right.. Dakota on the wall is a white-robed woman, broad yet maidenly.. Such power in her hand as she hails the wagon man's family.. I see Indians that crawl through this mural that recalls our history.. Who were the homestead wives?. Who were the gold rush brides?. Does anybody know?. Do their works survive their yellow fever lives in the pages they wrote?. The land was free, yet it cost their lives.. In miner's lust for gold, a family's house was bought and sold, piece by piece.. A widow staked her claim on a dollar and his name, so painfully.. In letters mailed back home her Eastern sisters. they would moan as they would read accounts of. madness, childbirth, loneliness and grief..";Sad

Hey Jack, now for the tricky part. When you were the brightest star. Who were the shadows?. Of the San Francisco beat boys. You were the favourite. Now they sit and rattle their bones.
