Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Every room-mate kept awake
By every sigh and scream we make
All the feelings that I get
But I still don't miss you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
Every time we lie awake
After every hit we take
Every feeling that I get
But I haven't missed you yet
Only when I stop to think about it
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
Only when I stop to think about you
I know
Only when you stop to think about me
Do you know?
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
You hate everything about me
Why do you love me?
I hate
You hate
I hate
You love me
I hate everything about you
Why do I love you?
